# Who am I?

* * *

Far from me the idea to do philosophy by answer to a self-knowledge question...

I'm Arthur Halet, a 22 years old lyonnais (A person who live in Lyon in France) and I'm a IT Developer.

I'm fond of IT technologies and web techonologies globally. In other hand, you will see, inside this website, that I used new technologies like HTML5 and CSS3 highlighted with Jquery (Javascript library).
